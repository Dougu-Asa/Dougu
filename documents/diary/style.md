- functions are for component declarations and arrow functions for methods. Basically, anything that returns jsx is a function. Else, it's a method.
- `export default` is for components/hooks, `export` is for methods and types.
- multi-line comments `/* */` are only used for file descriptions at the top. otherwise, use `//`
