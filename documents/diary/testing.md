## Login Jest Testing
Today, I setup a basic testing scheme using jest. I simply tested login.tsx, from /components. In order to do so, I ended up also installing react native testing library. Overall, it was quite troublesome due to my lack of experience with testing, but I was able to get the basics setup. I learned a lot of skills, such as mocking, jest-setup, and calling jest directly. There will be a lot more testing in the future, so I'll try to take things incrementally.
